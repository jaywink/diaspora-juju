  Diaspora, the privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all,
  open source social network, is a dicentralized social network
  that puts you in control of you own data. When you set up a
  personal pod, all your data is stored in that pod. You maintain
  ownership of everything you share on Diaspora, giving you full
  control over how it's distributed.
